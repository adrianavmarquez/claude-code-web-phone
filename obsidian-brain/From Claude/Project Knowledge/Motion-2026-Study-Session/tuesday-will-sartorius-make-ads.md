## Summary

Will Sartorius, CEO of SelfMade, presents a comprehensive tutorial on building an AI-assisted creative process for performance ads. He outlines two primary methods: a "quick win" approach for rapidly cloning competitor ads and animating static images, and a more advanced "scalable method" for building an iterative ad creation system using Claude Code, Fal.ai, Nano Banana 2, and Veo 3.1. The session emphasizes structured prompting, four-layer setup (brand extraction, reference cards, format templates, copywriting agents), and leveraging long, context-rich prompts to generate high-volume, on-brand ad creatives while keeping a human creative strategist in the loop.

## Tactics recommended (do this)

- Upload competitor ad to Claude (Opus model) with a deconstruction prompt that extracts ad format, copy, product, layout, background, typography, visual devices, color palette, and spacing — then rework for your brand.
- For animation, decide whether your existing static is the start frame or end frame, then use Nano Banana 2 to generate the missing frame.
- Generate Veo 3.1 video prompts as JSON in Claude, explicitly labeling start frame vs. end frame, then run in Google Labs Flow with 9x16 aspect.
- Iterate on bad video outputs by uploading the GIF/MP4 back to Claude, describing exactly what's wrong, and asking for a corrected JSON prompt that preserves what worked.
- Use Claude Code over Claude Chat for production scale — files in your folder are read automatically without re-uploading.
- Build a "cookbook" of format templates as markdown files: headline, testimonial, before/after, statistics, features-and-callouts, UGC-style, etc.
- Collect 5–6+ examples per ad format from Facebook ad library (use ImageI Chrome plugin), upload to Claude, classify and synthesize into a markdown template.
- Spin up 5–7 copywriting agents (persona fit, angle fit, emotional fit, brand fit, conversion, format, grammar) and require each to score 90+/100 before image generation.
- Use long prompts (1,000–1,500 words) loaded with brand context, hex codes (with reference card image), font references (with reference card image), safe zones, and explicit visual rules.
- Save EVERY output (extraction, spec cards, format templates, agents) into your project folder/Claude project — repeated reminder.
- For brand fonts/colors when no brand bible exists: inspect the brand's webpage in browser, search "font" and "color," paste raw CSS into Claude, ask it to update the spec cards.
- Convert PDFs/PowerPoints to markdown before uploading to Claude — PDFs get screenshotted page by page, wasting tokens.
- Use Fal.ai over native Gemini to generate four images at once and access every model.
- Whitelist AI ads from a side Facebook page (e.g., "Irish Beer Club") rather than the main brand page to insulate the brand from negative comments.
- Take winning brief, ask Claude to "rewrite this brief for each format template in my folder" to multiply one ad into many on-brand variants.

## Anti-patterns (don't do this)

- Don't just upload reference images and hope the AI captures the aesthetic — give it structured spec + visual style cards.
- Don't try to read or hand-engineer long prompts — they're for the machine. Iterate by feeding outputs back to Claude instead.
- Don't ask AI to "animate this static ad" directly — it doesn't work. Generate frames first.
- Don't use short prompts with Nano Banana 2 — it won't fill gaps gracefully (use Nano Banana Pro if you want assumption-filling).
- Don't upload PDFs directly to Claude — convert to markdown first.
- Don't upload more than 2–3 brand reference ads — contradictions hurt output.
- Don't use Higgsfield (speaker considers it shady) — use Fal.ai instead.
- Don't use AI UGC with fake doctors / fake people (morally and reputationally problematic).
- Don't try to volume-produce slop just for volume's sake — prioritize quality even within scaled workflows.
- Don't skip the human creative strategy work — the system assumes persona/angle/emotion are already decided.
- Don't forget to save extraction outputs, cards, templates, and agents — multiple "Stop. Save it." reminders throughout.

- "I'm not a designer. I'm innately lazy. So I have tried to come up with a system that requires the least amount of work for the most amount of output." — Will Sartorius
- "People love to overcomplicate this to make themselves seem smarter than they are. Prompts, markdown files, agents, skills — these are all just text files." — Will Sartorius
- "The last time I read a full prompt was probably two years ago." — Will Sartorius
- "Stop reading prompts. Stop trying to over-engineer your prompts. It will drive you crazy and it doesn't work." — Will Sartorius

## Verification notes

- Date corrected from structured (no date provided) to canonical 2026-04-07 (Week 4 Tuesday).
- Title corrected from structured implicit ("Building Your AI Creative Process") to canonical syllabus title "Make Some Ads!" — the in-deck title slide reads "Building Your AI Creative Process" but the bootcamp curriculum title is "Make Some Ads!"; preserved canonical.
- Speakers list verified: Will Sartorius (instructor) + Evan Lee (host/Head of Partnerships, Motion). No additional guests despite Q&A format. Marked guests: [].
- Duration 7291 sec (~2h 1m 31s) consistent with 5–7 PM UTC scheduled window.
- Slide #5 in extraction had a corrupted/repeated logo list (MuteSix loop) — disregarded the spam, used the clean logo list from the visible slide.
- The transcript field in the extraction is heavily duplicated/looped in the post-Q&A section (Evan's extended Q&A repeats verbatim many times) and ends with garbled Lightshot filename strings — flagged as transcription artifact, not session content. The actual session ended cleanly after Will's farewell and Evan's homework walkthrough; ignored the looped/garbled tail when extracting metadata.
- Brand name "Medby" / "Med-B" referenced as cautionary example (fake-doctor ads) — kept as-is, low confidence on exact spelling.
- "Harry Demage" likely "Harry Dry" or another spelling — Will explicitly said "probably butchering his last name." Left as transcribed.
- "Andromeda" referenced once (Meta's system requiring volume) — consistent with curriculum context.
- Hex code / font extraction tactic via browser Inspect verified across slide and verbal.
- Three-tier Claude framework (Cowork/Chat/Code) verified via slide and verbal explanation.
- Quote attribution for "slop is slop" corrected: spoken by Evan Lee citing community member Jen in Slack, not Evan's original.
- Otherwise all four extraction sources (transcript, slides, ads, structured) are consistent on the substantive content. Corrections applied: title, date, deduplication of looped transcript content, cleanup of spam logo list.
